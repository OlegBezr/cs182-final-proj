" Abortion is a crime, in America.
I am no longer a disbeliever in the doctrine of â€œconversionâ€ to secular life. I believe in it. To me, it is not even a crime to believe in the practice of a â€œconversionâ€ to Christianity. By contrast, I am convinced that abortion is â€œcruelâ€ and â€œunsureâ€ in itself. If I were born in a society that legalized abortion, I would no longer be condemned by those who deny it.
This was a common argument made before Roe v. Wade was struck down in 1995. If Roe v. Wade had held true today, abortion would not have taken away a womanâ€™s life and robbed her of the right to an abortion. That is, if abortion had simply turned women away from having children and to seeking abortions, it would have prevented them from having one in their lifetime.
That argument was made in 1923 by a group of",models_saves/model_save_pytorch_5epoch_left
" Abortion is an insult to all people. Abortion is an affront to society. Abortion is wrong. And it hurts. It is wrong to tell a patient what they should or should not be doing. It is wrong to treat women like criminals. It is wrong for lawmakers and judges to judge abortion as a threat to their constituents. It is wrong to criminalize the procedure that causes a pregnancy â€” a crime under the Protection of Life.
The Supreme Court has ruled that abortion is â€œunslawful and â€œcruelâ€ under the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects the individual right to life of the mother. Abortion falls within this right, whether you believe itâ€™s rape or not, because thatâ€™s a womanâ€™s right. (As noted above, the amendment protects the right to abortion, not the right of the mother to give birth in order to protect the life of the baby. But itâ€™s important nonetheless.)",models_saves/model_save_pytorch_5epoch_left
" Atheism is, in fact, a form of Christianity. Christianity is essentially a form of religion that predicated on God. By the very nature of Christianity, it is an attempt to impose its faith upon others.
For those who believe that their religion was instituted to bring about some sort of revelation from God, to gain eternal life, or to instruct others in ways that most profoundly affect them (whether they conform or not), this is simply an insult to those who hold it true and to those who believe it is a form of Christianity. Indeed, to hold it so falsely, or at least as false as Christianity,â€™s purpose is to obscure the true meaning of Christianity, and to maintain that it is a form of Christianity that does not follow its own principles of morality.
For those who believe that Christianity is primarily anachronistic and that its main purpose is to impose its religious doctrine onto others, this is simply an insult to those who hold it true and to those",models_saves/model_save_pytorch_5epoch_left

The White House is lying to Congress to tell the American people about how much of the federal budget it's spending, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington think tank.

In fact, while Trump has shown little interest in changing his rhetorical posture in the months since his inauguration as president, he has shown little interest in making changes.
