      "1: From Barack Obama to Hillary Clinton, the media and the Democratic Party have spent years chasing down an enemy who stands out, but is not the enemy.\n",
      "This is why, in 2017, the media has spent tens of millions of taxpayer dollars chasing down an enemy who stands out — but is not a foreign enemy. For good reason.\n",
      "First, the media's bias against Hillary Clinton highlights why the mainstream media is so disdainful of our president. Second, the media cloaks all of this in order to discredit and discredit Trump. Third, our media keeps telling it like it is, when it's obvious that our president is a dangerous rogue and an enemy of the United States. In other words, our media is corrupt.\n",
      "Let's examine how we treat our president.\n",
      "First, let me rephrase it. Our government and our culture have failed because the Democrats control both houses of Congress — and because the only way to stop them is to pass a tax cut for corporations, which would cut the national debt by 25%, a whopping $1 trillion over 10 years. This is what happened in 2008: The middle class was not growing so big that it could afford to give up on crushing Trump. The only way to stop this was to pass a tax cut for corporations, which would cut the deficit by 20%.\n",
      "But Trump and his team did not see the middle class coming together. They made policy after policy — and the tax cut for corporations would have paid for itself. That was the beginning of the end.\n",
      "This is why the Republicans lost control of Congress and proceeded to pursue tax cuts for corporations and unions. The GOP tax cuts for middle-class families would have paid for itself, even without Congress's enormous legislative strength.\n",
      "And yet, while Trump’s tax cuts for corporations and unions are helping keep the economy growing and keeping families together — they are intentionally harming the middle class.\n",
      "First, a tax cut for corporations would have made the tax cuts for many corporations smaller, leaving millions with little or no choice in the economic marketplace. Second, these cuts would have disproportionately benefited the wealthy, which would have saved the middle class. Third, those gains would have been offset by the massive tax cuts for corporations, which would have taken corporations away from struggling middle-class families.\n",
      "Those gains would have been offset by recapturing the tax cuts for corporations, which would have taken corporations away from working people who rely on government for their livelihood.\n",
      "Corporations and unions had already begun to struggle to form unions, but the tax break for them would have paid for itself. And because the Republicans passed the tax cut for corporations, unions were no longer able to organize and elect officials to oversee the companies, leaving them with little or no choice in the economic marketplace.\n",
      "Corporations now make up a small fraction of America’s workforce. They still make up a lot of the workforce, but their share of the national wealth falls.\n",
      "Corporations now make up almost half of a workforce, even in parts of Alabama that used to be blue state. That is because the Republican tax cuts for corporations have failed to deliver on a middle-class tax cut for corporations and unions, leaving tens of millions of Americans without a middle-class job.\n",
      "The bottom line is that Trump and his team — and the rest of us — need to get our politicians back on track.\n",
      "In 2016, only 30 percent of households owned their own money, a figure that would have amounted to 33.6% if everyone owned just one paycheck, or about $38,000 a year. Thanks to the Trump tax cuts for corporations, it’s now $110,000 a year.\n",
      "But if the middle class can claim 20% of their combined net worth from the rich, the value added by the rich will soar to more than $110 billion annually.\n",
      "Right now, 70% of all personal income over $200,000 goes to charity. Thus, the wealthiest 1% of Americans are still getting a ringworm. So when you add up the 26.5% of households that are actually getting a ringworm, it goes to a whopping $3.47 trillion. That is, as of today, 31.7% of all wealth in the country.\n",
      "That’s because many people still have not put enough money towards saving for a family.\n",
      "Corporations are already struggling with job losses because of Trump’s tax cuts. And they’re already struggling in part because of Trump’s insistence that corporations ‘reopen” their doors,” even though there are a lot of unions that support keeping them shut.\n",
      "The corporate tax cuts for corporations, however, have actually benefited the middle class and given them much more money. The corporate tax cut for corporations has been $11 trillion over 10 years. That’s attributable to one of Trump’s policies\n",

      "2: The Trump administration on Thursday said it is planning to phase out funding for abortion clinics in the District, even as opponents of such efforts say the policy falls short of protecting the vulnerable.\n",
      "The Trump administration on Thursday said it is planning to phase out its funding for abortion clinics, even though opponents of such efforts say the proposal would benefit patients’s health.\n",
      "In Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Andrew Bogusky appointed a three-judge panel to review the proposed change, which would extend federal law protections to abortion providers.\n",
      "The Judge, who came under fire for his decision to withhold federal funds in a case that threatened to reopen the state's abortion clinics after Trump signed an executive order in April, said Trump's intention is to terminate services for pregnant women from providers that receive taxpayer-funded Medicaid under Title X. “It’s time to move the case forward,\" Bogusky said, referring to a case from Arizona.\n",
      "The move, which goes against recent Supreme Court decisions by allowing states to deny legal abortion, could be the latest example of the Republican-led administration’s continued disregard of state reproductive rights while ignoring the threat to women of color.\n",
      "“The decision will affect every woman on this road to obtain an abortion,\" Bogusky said. “It’s time to move to a different path.”\n",
      "“You cannot turn the lights off during your child’s birth,” said Heidi Munoz, a director with Justice for Reproductive Rights. “The administration’s decision is not an accident; it’s a “executive order” and will not prevent women’s lives.”\n",
      "On Monday, the Obama administration canceled plans that included plans for more than 10,000 abortions in the District because of the Supreme Court’ order blocking states from making abortion decisions.\n",
      "In a letter to state Attorney General Xavier Becerra, Bogusky cited a lack of funding for a group that opposes abortion rights, stating “it’s important that the District Attorney be given the same resources and experience and expertise as the Department of Justice, which he appointed to review the proposal.”\n",
      "The decision on that claim is likely to trigger lawsuits, even though some of the claims that have been filed are limited to women seeking abortion services in the District.\n",
      "“We don’t know what the Supreme Court decision was because of what we know now, but it was an open secret that it was a decision that was put into place to protect “abortion providers. This ruling is in no way about “abortion in a patient’s state of mind or the fetus’s future. Abortion providers cannot provide abortions. It’s a violation of Title X of the U.S. Constitution to have any woman in the District have an abortion.”\n",
      "While the U.S. Supreme Court disagreed in January, its actions have now been blocked by the Justice Department, in part because of the Supreme Court’s refusal to grant protections to states’ rights based on their religious beliefs.\n",
      "In an interview with The Advocate, Bogusky told The Advocate that he agreed with the policy change for women, but said the administration \"may regret the decision\" and \"have a process\" in order to get the funding.\"\n",
      "“The reason that [The Advocate] is so interested is because of the lack of funds for abortion clinics in the District is “very important.” “For women's health, they’re so important,\" he said. “We will see what happens if this policy goes away.”\n",
      "On Thursday, Donald Trump told The Advocate he expected the new rules would be the same as existing restrictions on abortion, but added he wasn’t sure it would be implemented.\n",
      "Related: Partial birth abortions now illegal.\n",
      "The policy change, scheduled to take effect in 2021, was set to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2019, but the U.S. Attorney General’s Office said in a statement on Wednesday it was \"going to affect only the patients of color.\" The new ban, as it was originally proposed, will apply only to women seeking abortions in the District and only to women seeking medical care under Title X-19.\n",
      "Trump said the administration would look into the matter, though not before approving the expanded funding, adding in a tweet: “Not exactly exciting — but no one seems to want to be a striver or a mother to a newborn baby who goes through so much pain.”\n",
      "The Republican-led government shutdown on Nov. 6 sparked a national outcry after Senate Republicans balked at the plan because of a state law protecting women’s health. In October, U.S. District Judge Andrew Bogusky found the Obama administration did\n",

      "3: ’s tale of betrayal is a tale told at the intersection of two very different continents: one poisoned by drug and the other by society.\n",
      "“The American system of government does not give citizens the ability to influence the rest of the world,” George Ciccarierek, author of “The American Conservative, wrote in a piece for Salon this week.\n",
      "But this story of betrayal and betrayal is one that is being told by those in power. It’s the tale told at the intersection of two very different realities: one poisoned by drug and the other by social distorting influences.\n",
      "The American system of government allows unaccountable elites to make decisions about who is entitled to receive government assistance and who is not; and that system is fatally corrupt.\n",
      "Corruption and injustice are inseparable, and yet when these two realities meet, the American system of government becomes corrupt and its legitimacy and accountability are undermined by those in power—the United States Constitution and our culture.\n",
      "In the case of the United States, a president and a congresswoman have failed to take bold action to combat corporate greed, but the resulting erosion of the American political system—a system of checks and balances that systematically and deliberately prevents Americans from taking bold action to confront a system that systematically corrupts so much of our society, even as the costs of our economy and democracy soar. The consequences of this system cannot be fullyized, but they could be severe.\n",
      "America, then, is a nation of people of color, LGBTQ people, Native Americans, and the elderly. The system creates wealth by concentrating powerful men and women in large numbers, who then systematically push the rest of us into debt slavery, then enslaving and mistreatment of our most vulnerable citizens so that the system can continue to exist. The system is built on unequal pay and no protections for workers who don’t have the same protections as everyone else in the United States.\n",
      "The idea that the only way to restrain the powerful and powerful is to criminalize dissent is hopelessly false.\n",
      "The idea that this system of government protects individual liberty and well-being and, consequently, that the system should not be run by the rich and powerful is a sham. The system is run by people like the Koch brothers and Eric, and the wealthy and powerful get to hoard the wealth, while the rest of us live in luxury, in luxury, and in luxury for decades.\n",
      "Corporations run the government, and those who benefit from the system cannot survive if the system does not punish them or protect them.\n",
      "America is a country of people of color, LGBTQ people, and the elderly. Trump supports corporations and the wealthy and their wildly unequal treatment, while the rest of us live in the squalid conditions of the whiter past.\n",
      "Every citizen has the right to a fair shot at life and liberty, and we have to make the political system work for us, not for another man or woman who may have the power to enslave us.\n",
      "Donald Trump supports policies that encourage multinational corporations, and takes advantage of workers with lower incomes, while he systematically abuses the labor force and erodes the protections that protect the rule of law.\n",
      "Corporations and the rich have long been the purveyors of information, entertainment, promoted culture, promoted fear and intimidation, and promoted economic populism that has poisoned public life.\n",
      "Corporations have spent billions and millions of dollars in politics to advance their political ambitions—and to pour money and influence into the interests of the powerful few.\n",
      "The Trump orbit casts the entire U.S. system of government as a kind of “corporatism truther” and its failures reflect this. The mainstream media and the media establishment have failed to report the real motivations and motivations of Donald Trump, who openly flouts the American Constitution and supports corporate wealth.\n",
      "Corporatism truthers believe that every American must be a “winner” and that their political system represents “a system of people with fair wages, opportunity, and opportunity.” That system is corrupt, criminalized, and unaccountable, but at the same time, it’s a system of people who will never “reopen” their economies and “reopen” themselves to opportunity.\n",
      "Donald Trump’s obsession with deregulation and corporate tax cuts has poisoned the lives of tens of millions of people, leaving millions homeless, and making public schools in our cities and communities run by people of color and LGBTQ people even less secure.” That system will only work if it is built on merit.”\n",
      "America is the only true democracy where people have access to health care, public libraries, and free speech. We should not let a corrupt system run its business as usual, but rather we should harness the power of public decency so that people can achieve their full and “real’ change.\n",

      "4: In a meeting with a representative from the Republican Study Committee on Thursday, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) asked for an explanation for why President Donald Trump “replaced us with some random guy with some random haircut that just happened to look like a pretty woman and then he proceeded to tell everyone that he’s a good guy” and then proceeded to burn the White House on the spot.\n",
      "The conservative congresswoman added that “I don’t think it’s fair to assume that Trump is a good person, that his actions were objectively funny or that people were going to care if he was actually funny.”\n",
      "It was one of those heated exchanges that was made quite clear in the video. A visibly frustrated Gaetz tried to calmly explain his politics by saying, “Look, everybody knows that my name is Gaetz, I’m not an expert on politics or anything, but I think what he’s doing is wrong.” Gaetz said. “He needs to get on top of this.”\n",
      "When the video started to play, the congressman started to get a little frustrated, saying that the congresswoman’s words were “the wrong thing to say.”\n",
      "While the congressman then added, “I’m guessing you mean “it’s not me. I’m trying to make a point,” he said. “I’m a good person. I’m not going to back down. I’m not going to do anything to hurt you. And then he said again: “Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look.”\n",
      "The congressman later went on to suggest that “the Trump regime’s response’ was to use his personal Twitter feed and spread conspiracy theories that falsely suggested that Trump was pre-selected to run the coronavirus outbreak that caused the death of many Americans. “And’s this, “This is not news that my whole life is full of nonsense. This’s not news that our president did not have an active government job.”\n",
      "When Trump responded by saying, “I’m not going to back down. “We’re not doing this in this video,” Gaetz said. “If you don’t like it, I'm not going to back down.”\n",
      "The congressman went on to ask if he was being literal: “If you look at it, “You have to understand that these people want to use our public life,” he said. “They have to respect everybody’s privacy,” Gaetz said. “I’m “going to go get some privacy.”\n",
      "The GOP’s obsession with lying to the American public has nothing to do with the real economy. The congressman noted that he thinks that the real economy’s going to be worse in the next 12 months than it was two weeks ago.\n",
      "“Look, I don’t know what this all means for President Trump. I’m trying to make a point. If everything goes according to plan, this is going to be another six months.”\n",
      "“Look, look, I can’t imagine Trump’s doing anything but lying to the American public, and what’s going to happen next,” Gaetz said.\n",
      "“What’s going to happen next is we’re going to have another 6 months.”\n",
      "Trump’s bizarre behavior suggests that the Republicans are hopelessly out of touch with reality. But the Republican lawmaker’s comments suggest he believes that people can’t handle lying with the cameras.\n",
      "“If you’re looking at it, he’s not lying. He’s not telling the truth. He’s lying to everybody. That’s why people like me, the media and Dems are sick and tired of talking about his real life.”\n",
      "“He has to look at his Twitter feed,” Gaetz said. “So, we need to get to know him better,” he added.\n",
      "“I’m not going to back down on this one. We have to get to know each other and we have to take care of the rest,” Gaetz added.\n",
      "The conservative congressman hastened to note that, in the House, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has never endorsed Trump and has stood by the presumptive Republican presidential nominee without ever calling him a racist or a bigot.\n",

      "6: The United States is in chaos right now, and it's hard to tell what to do about it.\n",
      "First of all, Donald Trump’s ongoing obsession with the idea of “maximum pressure” from Democrats, liberals and independents is an obvious betrayal. Trump’s obsession with the idea that there would be “maximum pressure” from Democrats, progressives and independents — and then to use that to his advantage, when necessary, to nuh-uh a whole lot of things — has been doing its best to obscure this fact from the public and obscure a whole lot of things from the public. This obsession with the idea that there was somehow a conspiracy to stop the protests, to “go home” and “let people have a say in what’s going on around them. This is why, until very recently, I haven’t seen anything that compares with it. Certainly not with my own country, so I can assure you I have never seen anything like it.\n",
      "Since the first night of protests, one of the things that has kept the lights on for most of the nation has been the suppression of free speech. And the reason is clear. First of all, President Trump is in a very difficult situation. He needs to find a way to use his power to make the protests less threatening and more constructive, and he’s obviously no better with that than other administrations. But the more aggressive he goes, the more opportunities for disruptive behavior will be lost if he continues to waste his energies on making them more threatening and more constructive.\n",
      "Trump has been such a big-picture loser. Last week, he tried to play up the rhetorical tricks he used on MSNBC’s Chris Hayes during the Democratic primary debates to distract from the fact that he’d only occasionally barked at his opponent, claiming: ‘Well, listen to me, I like the hecklers.” And then, with almost every debate, I asked, ‘Look, they’re supposed to be pleasant and friendly,” ‘But what’s happening,” he said, ‘Are they giving in to Trump’s attacks?”\n",
      "That’s when things became ugly. And then the press started to spin the narrative, attributing the events to protesters as a spontaneous eruption of white nationalism. And that turned into a false flag.\n",
      "Now, Trump has been willing to say whatever he wants on the campaign trail, on national TV and in the press. And if he’s willing to admit he doesn’t know what’s going on, then the public will probably take notice. But if he goes around saying that everything is okay, that’s all. And his defenders will say that the president is lying, because the only way to defend him on Twitter is to pretend he is lying. But what’s happening now is that he’s lying.\n",
      "The real story is that Trump is lying.\n",
      "First of all, he thinks protesters are not peaceful people. That’s nonsense. There’s never been a protest that has generated more blood and destruction and more chaos than the one in Ferguson, Missouri, or the one in Pittsburgh. Trump has been lying to the American public for weeks, and he’d made up the entire story to try to discredit protesters. But the media has been covering this story for weeks, and the president has been lying since the beginning.\n",
      "Second, Trump has been encouraging a violent suppression of protest by enforcing a curfew on people who have never previously been in danger and have expressed a desire to keep it under control. The curfew is to allow police to come into the streets if they get a chance. If they have a chance to get out, they’re supposed to stay in their cars for 15 minutes, and then they have to drive home and get some rest.\n",
      "And on a recent night, the president said the curfew would go into effect, but protesters never showed up and the curfew was lifted a few hours later, on Monday, February 15, 2019. That was the night before the first American Indian and Alaska Native American protest outside the White House, which Trump had called “one of the worst things that’s happened to America during his presidency. “The curfew is meant to stop people from looting and threatening the lives of Americans so that’s what’s happening right now,” he said. “The looting hasn’t stopped yet. The looting has started.”\n",
      "Then there is the fact that Donald Trump himself is a big Trump fan.\n",
      "What makes this all a bit bizarre, perhaps, is that Trump’s favorite TV personality, the reality TV host, has a history of encouraging violent suppression of nonviolent protest by keeping the lights off in protest areas.\n",

      "7: A group of Republican congresswomen is calling on President Donald Trump to step up oversight of the Federal Election Commission, warning it will not meet its two-year term in the job. Rep. Ilhan Omar has proposed a second round of impeachment proceedings against members of Congress if they fail to take a tough stand against Trump.\n",
      "Congressman Omar is planning to introduce legislation, which would strip members of Congress of their right to vote, and would also strip federal funding from the watchdog to fund investigations into whether Trump pressured a woman to have an abortion because he wanted to see her vote for something that's supposed to benefit the American taxpayer.\n",
      "The move comes amid widespread concerns that Omar is planning to introduce legislation that would strip federal funding from the watchdog to fund investigations into his use of personal data to harass women and journalists. Omar, who resigned this week amid widespread pressure from conservative activists for his ouster from office, says he would introduce the legislation without congressional approval. \"This is a case where we have the president abusing our democracy for political reasons, and Congress can't do that,\" Omar said on \"Fox & Friends.\"\n",
      "Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) asked why Omar would introduce such a drastic change, and Omar said that his plan would target people who can be seen as corrupt for what they are.\n",
      "The newly-elected conservative congresswoman noted that there was no way Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez could be removed, and suggested that if Omar did not introduce similar legislation, she would introduce a second round of impeachment proceedings against her.\n",
      "Congressman Omar added that his plan would be transparent and would require congressional oversight, and said he would introduce such a measure this week, if it takes effect.\n",
      "“When people ask me, I think it is a little too far from the spirit of the Constitution. It is a violation of the separation of powers to interfere, and it seems unenforceable in practice.”\n",
      "But Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), one of the country’s largest members of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, has said that Omar’s proposal is a grab grab-bag of abuses of power.\n",
      "“My bill would strip the power of congressional oversight and punish members for breaking it, and I would introduce a second round of impeachment proceedings against members of Congress for lying to the American people.”\n",
      "It’s a grab grab-bag of abuses from the 1990s when there was Rep. Bobby Rush (R-Tenn.), who authored the 1994 rape and murder of 13 women.\n",
      "“I don’t think the American people want Congress’s oversight under control” the way they want it now. They want our investigation to continue, and their members are being caged up. This is why we have to change our leadership.”\n",
      "In a recent interview with Democracy Now, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who serves on the House Judiciary Committee, called Omar’s proposal a grab-bag of abuses from the 1990s when there was Rep. Bobby Rush.\n",
      "In a speech to lawmakers Tuesday, the conservative congressman echoed his earlier argument that his goal will be transparent and transparent.\n",
      "”Look at who sits in chairs of committees.”\n",
      "“These committees are full of corrupt members, who are abusing power by lying to the American people, or by abusing a system that should be transparent and accountability. We should bring it to the House floor and then there will be consequences.”\n",
      "Ocasio-Cortez said his proposal would be an abdication of leadership and a forfeit to the American people.\n",
      "“Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez has always held that the American people deserve our support, and we should support our investigations,” Rep. Omar told Democracy Now.\n",
      "In his new letter, he seeks to use Rep. Omar’s proposal to strip the power of congressional oversight on an executive branch task force, an act lawmakers say is contrary to Trump’s stated desire to make the appointment of an independent, non-partisan watchdog.\n",
      "“The American people deserve our support and the Department of Justice should have the ability to compel an end to our investigations into Trump abuses and abuses of power and accountability. “”\n",
      "The proposal also lists six recommendations:\n",
      "Replacing the Office of Technology Assessment with an independent agency that would audit the nation’s domestic policy, “investigators responsible for investigating Trump crimes should “not be given power to unilaterally ‘examine and report on a specific case,” and ‘the power of a non-partisan commission to select an external auditor who will review and audit all aspects of our investigations.”\n",

      "But there's no evidence that it’s actually possible for people to lie. There’s just no evidence that it’s possible that they will be rewarded’s downfall.\n",
      "What lies in this case are two things: One, lying and lying are parts of the same coin. If Trump doesn’t lie, he probably does. And two, lying is part of his political career and in some ways he probably does.\n",

      "9: The White House’s proposed budget proposal on Thursday calls for cutting U.S. military and domestic security aid to “faster and more efficient” in the event of a terrorist attack.\n",
      "“The proposed elimination of military assistance to Iraq and Afghanistan will produce a “reCOVID-19” death count,” said Matthew Watts, chief executive of the White House’s Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n",
      "A study published last week found that “military readiness is declining as people are losing the battle against ISIS and other radical Islamists that ISIS waged in Syria and Iraq.\n",
      "“The military is struggling to fulfill its mission in Iraq and fighting ISIS in Syria, the Pentagon said. “Retired U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Mark Esper and his wife, Nellie, are helping the Iraqi government prepare for the Iraqi offensive and continuing to assist American forces. “The proposed elimination of U.S. funding to the Iraqi military’s fighting forces could lead to a decline in U.S. funding given the military is still struggling with the ongoing humanitarian crisis.”\n",
      "“There’s a chance that, once this attack is over, the U.S. might reach an agreement on a political settlement of the conflict and the need to maintain U.S. support and assistance for the Iraqi government, but it’s unlikely the issue can be resolved with U.S.-trained Iraqi forces. “As there have been concerns about the loss of U.S. combat troops and staff to fight ISIS, U.S. policy hasn’t been to support the Iraqi government.”\n",
      "“The U.S. military has no plans to support the Iraqi government in fighting ISIS.” U.S. combat troops are advising its Iraqi partners in Europe and Japan not to join with the U.S.-trained Iraqi forces,” he said, in an interview with Fox News last week. “There are risks in supporting the Iraqi government with U.S. troops, but in the end, the United States will not support them.””\n",
      "“When you say “Iraq is losing to ISIS, you have to say it was a sustainable strategy because ISIS was already devastating the country and the world with its vicious behavior,” Watts said. “Iraq has had success in fighting the terrorist group but, realistically, it’s a different story.”\n",
      "On Monday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, “The U.S. is working with partners to prepare for a successful, non-shammar-like attack against the ISIS terror group, which has killed more than 2,300 people and displaced more than 4 million people from their homes.”\n",
      "President Donald Trump’s proposed Pentagon spending cuts would hit “programs that’re”funding the military and humanitarian efforts to the U.S. “America is fighting ISIS,” Sanders said, adding that “America is still “on track to combat ISIS.\"\n",
      "The Trump administration’s proposal has added to the escalating conflict that has engulfed western Iraq and is causing lasting damage to the region. “The United States is now “talking to Baghdad about possible U.S.-backed military action against ISIS.”\n",
      "On Thursday, Reuters reported the Pentagon had proposed to deploy U.S. naval forces to Iraq. “The U.S. plans to deploy four U.S. naval destroyers to attack ISIS positions along the border, near the city of Hawija, Syria.”\n",
      "In the first, the Pentagon said, two U.S. destroyers will arrive in Baghdad and one American destroyer would arrive in Baghdad on Sunday, while the other two were moved to ISIS-held territories in northern Iraq, south of Diyala.\n",
      "In the second, Mattis ordered the Pentagon to deploy four U.S. Navy destroyers on a mission against ISIS positions, according to a White House statement. “Both the U.S.-Iraqi cooperation and the coalition partners have agreed to deploy support and equipment to ensure a safe zone.”\n",
      "White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters this afternoon, “We have been talking to Baghdad about this for months about it,” and called on them to take actions to combat ISIS. “We have seen what has happened to the U.S. in Iraq. “We have seen what we can’t put an exact timeline on now. ”\n",
      "Iraqi officials have already told Reuters that U.S. military personnel are advising their Iraqi partners in Europe to join the attack in Iraq because of the increased tensions between the government and ISIS, and that the U.S. military may deploy additional American naval support to reinforce the\n",
